```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

### Load packages
mypackages <- c("here", "tidyverse")

for(i in mypackages){
  library(i, character.only = T)
}
```

In this markdown, we are going to generate and recode some variables that we are going to need to conduct our analysis 

First, you will need to update the filepath below to the appropriate location on your computer. Make sure the folder with the datafiles (I named it data) is saved inside your working directory. To view your working directory run the following command getwd(). To set a new working directory use setwd("FILEPATH") and use the FILEPATH for that directory, for example setwd("C:/Luis/Analysis of Complex Survey/").

### Load data
```{r load, }

list.files(here("data/")) ### this command shows the files in the working directory. We are going to import the dataset "nsduh.RData"

### Importing dataset NSDUH 2002 - 2011
load(here("data/", "nsduh.RData"))

```

### Exploring the dataset 
It is always good practice to explore your dataset and understand what are you working with.
The characteristics of an object are important to work it in R.

Many softwares other than R have some sort of way to explore the dataset in a separate window. This is not super useful in R, but if you miss that use the View() command.
In R, there are other, more useful, ways to explore and manipulate the dataset.
```{r explore, }
### View dataset
View(nsduh)

```

#### Q: What is the class of this object?
```{r class, }
class(nsduh)
```

#### Q: How many observations are in this dataframe? 
```{r obs, }
nrow(nsduh)
```

#### Q: How many variables are in this dataframe?
Can you name 3 variables that have different classes? and what are these classes?

```{r n var, }
str(nsduh)
```

#### Q: Print the first 30 observations in the dataframe
```{r 30 obs, }
head(nsduh, n = 30)
```

#### Q: Print the last 6 observations in the dataframe
```{r tail, }
tail(nsduh)
```

#### Q: Get a summary of the dataset
summary() provides a summary of the data. 
For categorical variables (factors), we get the N for each level of such variable.
For numeric variables, we get some summary statistics (e.g. mean, median, quantiles).
If there are missings it will show the total of "NA's".
```{r summary, }
summary(nsduh)

```

#### Q: Are there missing data in this dataframe?
In R, missings are called NA's. We can call on other packages like skimr and use the function skim() to get a prettier and more informative summary of the dataframe
```{r miss, }
library(skimr)

skim(nsduh)

```

### Data manipulation
We are going to create new variables of race, age, period indicator, indicator of nonmedical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO), NMUPO frequency, and survey weights.

#### Q: How would you find the names of the original variables in the nsduh dataframe? 
The names() function returns a list containing the names of an object.
In the case of a dataframe, it returns the names of the columns (variable names).
```{r names, }
names(nsduh)

```

#### Create a new and recoded variable of race 

Before making changes to a variable, it is useful to explore in depth the original variable.
```{r recode race, }
### Explore the original variable
class(nsduh$newrace2) ### what class is this variable?

### tabulate the original variable
nsduh |>
  group_by(newrace2) |>
  count()

levels(nsduh$newrace2) ### levels of this variable

### Can you think of other ways of exploring this variable?
nsduh |> 
  skim(newrace2)

str(nsduh$newrace2)

plot(nsduh$newrace2)

### create a new variable called race
nsduh <- nsduh |>
  mutate(race = ifelse(newrace2 == "NonHisp Native Am/AK Native" |  
                         newrace2 == "NonHisp Native HI/Other Pac Isl" | 
                         newrace2 == "NonHisp Asian" | 
                         newrace2 == "NonHisp more than one race", 4,
                       ifelse(newrace2 == "Hispanic", 3, 
                              ifelse(newrace2 == "NonHisp White", 1, 2)))) 

### check the new variable compared to the original one
nsduh |>
  group_by(newrace2, race) |>
  count()

### Transform the new race variable to be a factor and assign labels
nsduh <- nsduh |>
  mutate(race = factor(race, labels = c("Whites", "Blacks", "Hispanics", "Others")))

### check the new variable compared to the original one
nsduh |>
  group_by(newrace2, race) |>
  count()


```

#### Other recodings
```{r other recode, }
nsduh <- nsduh |>
  mutate(freq_nmupo = factor(ifelse(iranlfy < 30, 1, 
                                    ifelse(iranlfy > 29 & iranlfy < 100, 2, 
                                           ifelse(iranlfy > 99 & iranlfy < 366, 3, 0))), 
                             labels = c("No use", "1-29 days", "30-99 days", "100+ days")), 
         age2_num = as.numeric(age2), 
         age = factor(ifelse(age2_num < 13, 1, 2), 
                      labels = c("12-25 yrs", "26+ yrs")), 
         year_r = factor(ifelse(year < 2008, 0, 1), labels = c("2002-2005", "2008-2011")), 
         anlyr_r = recode(anlyr, "Did not use in the past year (IRANLRC = 3,9)" = "No PY use", 
                          "Used within the past year (IRANLRC = 1,2)" = "Any PY NMUPO"), 
         heryr_r = recode(heryr, "Did not use in the past year (IRHERRC = 3,9)" = "No PY use", 
                          "Used within the past year (IRHERRC = 1,2)" = "Any PY use"), 
         wt_new = analwt_c / 4)

### save the dataframe as an R dataset.
save(nsduh, file = here("data/", "nsduh_ready4analysis.RData"))
### export the dataframe as a .csv file.
write.csv(nsduh, file = here("data/", "nsduh_ready4analysis.csv"))


```

[SAMHSA recommends that for the] "...estimation of the *annual average
number of individuals* who have engaged in a particular behavior based upon pooled data from
multiple years requires adjustment to the analysis weights. These adjusted weights would be
created as the final weight divided by the number of years of combined data”

Since the analysis of Martins et al 2015 paper compares the prevalences of heroin use
between two four-year periods: 2002-2005 and 2008-2011, we need to adjust the original
weights. We are going to create a new weight variable that is divided by 4, which is
the number of years pooled per period.
